# Consider them "if I turn this now", and also "if I leave this now"
# wow

# Or ... 
# Redo the map so we move directly to where we're turning something. 
# Include the time to turn on valve in the "time to make that move" calculation.
# Never be stood in front of a valve deciding whether to turn it on, we've either 
# moved here to turn it, or we've run right past it.

# A table of: where we could step to, and what the cost / gain would be, given our 
# location and the time remaining.
# Global hash table so we can look it up in future, only calcualte new values when we 
# need to.
# That might get too big and slow - but it's a start!
